# Currency objects
# Must be created with an amount and a currency code.
# Must equal another Currency object with the same amount and currency code.
# Must NOT equal another Currency object with different amount or currency code.
# Must be able to be added to another Currency object with the same currency code.
# Must be able to be subtracted by another Currency object with the same currency code.
# Must raise a DifferentCurrencyCodeError when you try to add or subtract two Currency objects with different currency codes.
# Must be able to be multiplied by an int or float and return a Currency object.
# Currency() must be able to take one argument with a currency symbol embedded in it, like "$1.20" or "â‚¬ 7.00", and figure out the correct currency code. It can also take two arguments, one being the amount and the other being the currency code.
